# Introduction

I created this "macropad" as at work, I was constantly getting told that I am stepping away from my computer without locking it. I am aware that this is bad hygiene, but I am also exceedingly lazy. The main reason I did this was because on MacOS, there is no easy shortcut to lock the computer. This is especially true with MacBooks with non-US keyboard layout. 

I wanted to create a button that I could easily push, and it would lock my computer. I drooled over the [Steak Deck](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B06W2KLM3S/), but was put off by its cost.

Having built an [Ergodox](https://www.ergodox.io/) keyboard from scratch a few years ago, I decided to give making a macropad a go.

# Parts required

1. Access to a 3d printer for case. I personally own a [ANYCUBIC i3 Mega S](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07KCGN34W), and used that.

1. Cherry compatible key switches. Here, you can go crazy. I ordered mine from [CANDYKEYS](https://candykeys.com/category:switches). I personally used [Cherry MX Blue](https://candykeys.com/product/cherry-mx-blue-plate-m).

1. Keycaps. I ordered mine from [AliExpress](https://de.aliexpress.com/). Any of the suppliers will do; just make sure they are cherry-compatible. Personally, I ordered a bunch of [random colors from this seller](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/4000480076757.html). Mine took about a month to arrive.

1. Soldering iron. I used [this cheap one](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B07WYLF6QV/). Any would do, just be careful with it.
